The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that provides a runtime environment to execute java bytecode.

The java program is converted into java bytecode which is then translated by the JVM into machine code which can be then understood by the CPU to get the output.

 

B. Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides java libraries, the JVM and other files and documents that are needed to run java applications.

 

C. Java Development Kit (JDK):
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a superset of JRE and is used to create java applications. There are three JDK provided by Oracle; Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), Java Standard Edition (Java SE), and Java Mobile Edition (Java ME).
